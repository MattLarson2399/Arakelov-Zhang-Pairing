Some code to compute the Arakelov-Zhang pairing between two rational functions P1->P1 defined over a number field

See https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1875 for the definition

Can compute the Arakelov-Zhang pairing with x^2 quickly (use average_compare_basepoint) and between a polynomial and rational function in general

Can run into numerical issues

Written mainly in fall of 2018 while working on a project with Andrew Bridy
